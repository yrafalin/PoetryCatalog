The Cheeseburger served hot and fresh on National Cheeseburger Day
By Ypoavx
The sesame seeds are rich ivory, tiny drops sprinkling an ocean
The second bun is a beautiful shade of tan and beige, a clean surface
The tomato, a maroon perfect circle, but for small divots in the sides
The lettuce is veined and light green, a silk screen in front of a world of branches
The cheese, a maize colored square, corners sliding down the side of the patty
The ketchup, red and nothing else, just enough to add that taste  
The patty is juicy brown, just enough pink to variate the shaded
The first bun, holding everything up, that same shade of tan that of itâ€™s partner
And maybe there is a hand, what ever color you may imagine it to be, holding everything
